# Turing Machine in PowerPoint
Little project without any practical uses.
This document allows the user to program and launch a simple Turing Machine in PowerPoint.
# Specifications
The Turing Machine has 4 states, 2 symbols (0 and 1) and 18 cells on a vertical looping tape.
Once programmed the head starts on the first cell and continuously execute these instructions:
- READ
- SET STATE
- WRITE
- STOP if HALT
- MOVE (up or down)

Each instruction require the user to left click on a fixed position of the dipositive (the center).
Thus an autoclicker (with a maximum safe speed of 10 clicks per second) can perfectly execute a program.
